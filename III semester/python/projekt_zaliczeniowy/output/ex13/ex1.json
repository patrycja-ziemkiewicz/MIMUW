        "mechanism_of_action":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]\n\nCetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K\/Akt, Jak\/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]\n\nK-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase\/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.\n\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593].

The affinity (Kd) of EPO for its receptor on human cells is ∼100 to 200 pM [A33080]. Upon binding to EPO-R on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, a conformational change is induced which brings EPO-R-associated Janus family tyrosine protein kinase 2 (JAK2) molecules into close proximity. JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins [A33079]. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x [A33079]. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2\/STAT5\/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-γ1 [A33079].",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2b. Peginterferon alfa-2b is derived from the alfa-2b moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase\/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2b has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.\n\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2b for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593].

Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.",

        "type":"biotech",
        "description":"Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\n\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \n\nMarketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\n\nHuman insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA \"black box\" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. \n\nHuman Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. \n\nHuman insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.\n\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

Following subsequent antigen exposure, cross-linking of the antigen occurs by several Fc€RI-bound IgE molecules on the surface of both basophils and mast cells.

Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\n\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \n\nMarketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], or [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\n\nInsulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. \n\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",

        "mechanism_of_action":"Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and <i>m<\/i>-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties.",

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades.

Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature “beta” differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility.

Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels. Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).

Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction.[A228013] This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction.[A228013] It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V<sub>1<\/sub> and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses.[A228013, L31413]\n\nV<sub>2<\/sub> receptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys.[A228018, A228023] Vasopressin binding to V<sub>2<\/sub> causes activation of a G<sub>s<\/sub> protein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its trafficking to the cell surface.[A228018, A228023] Increased AQP2 levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.[A228018]\n\nV<sub>3<\/sub> (formerly V<sub>1B<\/sub>) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain.[A228008, A228018] Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through V<sub>3<\/sub> and by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, V<sub>3<\/sub> activation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.[A228008]\n\nThus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from 20 to 200 times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation.[A228013, A228018] In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V<sub>1<\/sub> receptors. Therefore, vasopressin helps decrease the dose requirement for norepinephrine and is routinely administered together with norepinephrine to restore normal blood pressure in shock states.[A228018, L31413]",

        "description":"Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody [A40276] that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2).[L14015] It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].\n\nIn December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a biosimilar drug approved in December 2018 for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) is another biosimilar approved by the FDA in June 2019.[L14135] ONTRUZANT, another biosimilar of Herceptin, was approved by Health Canada in February 2022.[L40303, L40308] In November 2023, trastuzumab was also approved by the EMA under the brand name Herwenda.[L49339]",

It can also be used in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumors > 2 cm in diameter.[L49324]\n\nTrastuzumab is also indicated, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease by the FDA and EMA.[L14015]\n\nTrastuzumab is indicated for subcutaneous administration - in combination with either [hyaluronidase][L14132] or both hyaluronidase and [pertuzumab][L14510] - for the treatment of adults with HER2-positive breast cancers.",
        "mechanism_of_action":"Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the HER-2 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors which is a photo-oncogene. Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and\/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras\/Raf\/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase\/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)\/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K\/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121]. While the drug alone has a minimal potential to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),[A201902] one study demonstrated increased therapeutic effectiveness and a synergistic effect on uterine serous carcinoma cells _in vitro_ when used in combination with [pertuzumab], which also has minor effects on CDC alone. This study showed that only the combination of both cell-bound antibodies would be sufficient to bind and activate the complement component 1q (C1q) required to initiate the complement cascade reaction.[A201896]\n\nIntrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor [A40276].",

About 85% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cases are B-cell lymphomas, characterized by the high expression of CD19, CD20 and CD22 cell surface antigens.[A248980] CD20 is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and calcium signaling. By targeting CD20, rituximab promotes cell lysis while sparing hematopoietic and plasma cells without this surface antigen.[A40017,A248980] It has been suggested that cell lysis mechanisms triggered by rituximab include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [L26641]. Rituximab is part of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass of antibodies, and is formed by a murine variable region (Fab region) and a human constant region (Fc region). The Fab region gives rituximab its specificity for CD20, while the Fc region interacts with cell surface receptors to activate the immune system, leading to the depletion of circulating B lymphocytes [A40017].\n\nIn regards to the mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B-cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA and the associated condition of chronic synovitis.[L26641] B-cells may act at various sites in the autoimmune\/inflammatory process through the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines [L26641]. The administration of rituximab in this condition has resulted in significant clinical and symptomatic improvements [A125,L26641]. Rituximab is also indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), two conditions characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and increased B-cell activity. It has been suggested that rituximab depletes CD20<sup>+<\/sup> B-cells at a higher rate in GPA and MPA patients with high levels of Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5).[A248985]",

Failure to do so may result in suboptimal treatment, treatment failure, and the development of drug-resistant bacteria.[L32534]",
        "mechanism_of_action":"The mechanism of action of daptomycin remains poorly understood. Studies have suggested a direct inhibition of cell membrane\/cell wall constituent biosynthesis, including peptidoglycan, uridine diphosphate-N-acid, acetyl-L-alanine, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). However, no convincing evidence has been presented for any of these models, and an effect on LTA biosynthesis has been ruled out by other studies in _S. aureus_ and _E. faecalis_.[A231384, A231394, A14171]\n\nIt is well understood that free daptomycin (apo-daptomycin) is a trianion at physiological pH, which binds Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to become a monoanion, which is thought to rely primarily on the Asp(7), Asp(9), and L-3MeGlu12 residues that form a DXDG motif.[A231374, A231379, A231384] Calcium-binding facilitates daptomycin's insertion into bacterial membranes preferentially due to their high content of the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), wherein it is proposed that daptomycin can bind two calcium equivalents and form oligomers.[A231379] PG is recognized as the main membrane requirement for daptomycin activity; daptomycin preferentially localizes in PG-rich membrane domains, and mutations affecting PG prevalence are linked to daptomycin resistance.[A231379] Calcium-dependent membrane binding is the generally accepted mechanism of action for daptomycin, but the precise downstream effects are unclear, and numerous models have been proposed.\n\nOne mechanism proposes that the daptomycin membrane binding alters membrane fluidity, causing dissociation of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes such as the lipid II synthase MurG and the phospholipid synthase PlsX.[A231384] This is consistent with the observed effects of daptomycin on cell shape in various bacteria at concentrations at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).[A14171] Aberrant cell morphology is also consistent with the observed localization of daptomycin at the division septa and a hypothesized role in inhibiting cell division.[A231379] A recent study suggested the formation of tripartite complexes containing calcium-bound daptomycin, PG, and various undecaprenyl-coupled cell envelope precursors, which subsequently include lipid II. This complex is proposed to inhibit cell division, lead to the dispersion of cell wall biosynthetic machinery, and eventually cause lysis of the membrane bilayer at the septum causing cell death.[A231384, A231409]\n\nAnother popular model is based on early observations that daptomycin, in a calcium-dependent manner, caused potassium ion leakage and loss of membrane potential in treated bacterial cells.[A231394, A231419, A231424] Although this lead some to suggest that daptomycin could bind PG to form oligomeric pores in the bacterial membrane,[A231384] no cell lysis was observed in _S. aureus_ or _E. faecalis_,[A231379] and the daptomycin-induced ion conduction is inconsistent with pore formation.[A231429] Rather, it has been proposed that daptomycin forms calcium-dependent dimeric complexes in fixed ratios of Dap<sub>2<\/sub>Ca<sub>3<\/sub>PG<sub>2<\/sub>, which can act as transient ionophores.[A231429] The observed loss of membrane potential is suggested to result in a non-specific loss of gradient-dependent nutrient transport, ATP production, and biosynthesis, leading to cell death.[A231379, A231424]\n\nNotably, these models are not strictly mutually exclusive and are supported to varying extents by observed resistance mutations. The strict requirement for PG for daptomycin bactericidal action is supported by mutations in _mprF_, _cls2_, _pgsA_, and the _dlt_ operon in _S. aureus_, _cls_ in various enterococci, and _pgsA_, PG synthase, and the _dlt_ operon in _E. faecium_, all of which alter the bacterial membrane composition and specifically the PG content of bacterial membranes. Other noted mutations in various regulatory systems that control membrane homeostasis also support the cell membrane as the site of daptomycin action. Curiously, in _E. faecalis_, the most commonly observed form of daptomycin resistance is characterized by abnormal division septa, which supports the cell division-based mechanism of daptomycin action.[A231379, A231384]",

It is not to be used in combination with immunosuppressants or inhibitors of TNF-α.[L48031, L48036]",
        "mechanism_of_action":"Integrins are transmembrane receptors and adhesion molecules that facilitate the chemotaxis of leukocytes to inflammation sites.[A261326] Made up of multiple subunits, α4 integrins form heterodimers with β-subunits to form functional molecules.[A261321] During inflammation, endothelial cells lining blood vessels are activated by cytokines. There is increased expression of cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), expressed on vascular endothelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. These cell adhesion molecules act as ligands or counter-receptors for α4 integrin receptors expressed primarily on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. The interaction between cell adhesion molecules and α4 integrin facilitates the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue, activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, and enhanced activity of local cytokines and chemokines. α4 integrin can also interact with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and osteopontin to further propagate inflammation.[A261321, L48031] Natalizumab binds to the α4 subunit of α4β1 and α4β7 integrin receptors to block the α4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptors. In vitro, natalizumab also blocks α4-mediated cell binding to osteopontin and an alternatively spliced domain of fibronectin, connecting segment-1 (CS-1). In vivo, natalizumab may further inhibit the interaction of α4-expressing leukocytes with their ligand(s) in the extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells, thereby inhibiting further recruitment and inflammatory activity of activated immune cells.[L48031]\n\nThe specific mechanism(s) by which natalizumab exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease have not been fully defined. Lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves the interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells and their counter-receptors expressed on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Natalizumab blocks the molecular interaction of α4β1-integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells and with CS-1 and\/or osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain; thereby, natalizumab reduces leukocyte migration into brain parenchyma and reduces plaque formation associated with MS.[A261326, L48031]\n\nThe interaction of the α4β7 integrin with the endothelial receptor MAdCAM1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD). MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and is critical in homing T lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue found in Peyer’s patches. Increased MAdCAM-1 expression is often observed at active inflammation sites in patients with CD, suggesting that MAdCAM-1 may be involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa. The clinical effect of natalizumab in CD may, therefore, be secondary to the blockade of the molecular interaction of the α4ß7 integrin receptor with MAdCAM-1 expressed on the venular endothelium at inflammatory foci. VCAM-1 expression has been found to be upregulated on colonic endothelial cells in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease and appears to play a role in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation; however, the role of VCAM-1 in CD is unclear.[L48031]",

About 85% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cases are B-cell lymphomas, characterized by the high expression of CD19, CD20 and CD22 cell surface antigens.[A248980] CD20 is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and calcium signaling. By targeting CD20, rituximab promotes cell lysis while sparing hematopoietic and plasma cells without this surface antigen.[A40017,A248980] It has been suggested that cell lysis mechanisms triggered by rituximab include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [L26641]. Rituximab is part of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass of antibodies, and is formed by a murine variable region (Fab region) and a human constant region (Fc region). The Fab region gives rituximab its specificity for CD20, while the Fc region interacts with cell surface receptors to activate the immune system, leading to the depletion of circulating B lymphocytes [A40017].\n\nIn regards to the mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B-cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA and the associated condition of chronic synovitis.[L26641] B-cells may act at various sites in the autoimmune\/inflammatory process through the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines [L26641]. The administration of rituximab in this condition has resulted in significant clinical and symptomatic improvements [A125,L26641]. Rituximab is also indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), two conditions characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and increased B-cell activity.

JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins [A33079]. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x [A33079]. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2\/STAT5\/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-γ1 [A33079].",

        "mechanism_of_action":"Integrins are transmembrane receptors and adhesion molecules that facilitate the chemotaxis of leukocytes to inflammation sites.[A261326] Made up of multiple subunits, α4 integrins form heterodimers with β-subunits to form functional molecules.[A261321] During inflammation, endothelial cells lining blood vessels are activated by cytokines. There is increased expression of cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), expressed on vascular endothelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. These cell adhesion molecules act as ligands or counter-receptors for α4 integrin receptors expressed primarily on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. The interaction between cell adhesion molecules and α4 integrin facilitates the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue, activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, and enhanced activity of local cytokines and chemokines. α4 integrin can also interact with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and osteopontin to further propagate inflammation.[A261321, L48031] Natalizumab binds to the α4 subunit of α4β1 and α4β7 integrin receptors to block the α4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptors. In vitro, natalizumab also blocks α4-mediated cell binding to osteopontin and an alternatively spliced domain of fibronectin, connecting segment-1 (CS-1). In vivo, natalizumab may further inhibit the interaction of α4-expressing leukocytes with their ligand(s) in the extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells, thereby inhibiting further recruitment and inflammatory activity of activated immune cells.[L48031]\n\nThe specific mechanism(s) by which natalizumab exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease have not been fully defined. Lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves the interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells and their counter-receptors expressed on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Natalizumab blocks the molecular interaction of α4β1-integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells and with CS-1 and\/or osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain; thereby, natalizumab reduces leukocyte migration into brain parenchyma and reduces plaque formation associated with MS.[A261326, L48031]\n\nThe interaction of the α4β7 integrin with the endothelial receptor MAdCAM1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD). MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and is critical in homing T lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue found in Peyer’s patches. Increased MAdCAM-1 expression is often observed at active inflammation sites in patients with CD, suggesting that MAdCAM-1 may be involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa. The clinical effect of natalizumab in CD may, therefore, be secondary to the blockade of the molecular interaction of the α4ß7 integrin receptor with MAdCAM-1 expressed on the venular endothelium at inflammatory foci. VCAM-1 expression has been found to be upregulated on colonic endothelial cells in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease and appears to play a role in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation; however, the role of VCAM-1 in CD is unclear.[L48031]",

It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].\n\nIn December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+).

        "mechanism_of_action":"Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the HER-2 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors which is a photo-oncogene. Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and\/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras\/Raf\/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase\/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)\/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K\/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121]. While the drug alone has a minimal potential to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),[A201902] one study demonstrated increased therapeutic effectiveness and a synergistic effect on uterine serous carcinoma cells _in vitro_ when used in combination with [pertuzumab], which also has minor effects on CDC alone. This study showed that only the combination of both cell-bound antibodies would be sufficient to bind and activate the complement component 1q (C1q) required to initiate the complement cascade reaction.[A201896]\n\nIntrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor [A40276].",

Four additional amino acid changes were made to facilitate the molecular construction, and a corresponding synthetic DNA sequence was constructed using chemical synthesis methodology. Interferon alfacon-1 differs from interferon alfa-2b at 20\/166 amino acids (88% homology), and comparison with interferon-beta shows identity at over 30% of the amino acid positions. Interferon alfacon-1 is produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells that have been genetically altered by insertion of a synthetically constructed sequence that codes for Interferon alfacon-1. Prior to final purification, Interferon alfacon-1 is allowed to oxidize to its native state, and its final purity is achieved by sequential passage over a series of chromatography columns.

Dale first identified oxytocin and its uterine contractile properties in 1906.[A229008,A228593,A229108] Like all other neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin is composed of nine amino acids with a disulfide bridge between the Cys 1 and 6 residues.[A229008,A228593] In the mid-1950s, synthetic oxytocin was successfully synthesized by a biochemist named Vincent du Vigneaud; he was later recognized with a Nobel prize for his work.[A229108] Oxytocin continues to be an important tool in modern obstetrics to induce labor when indicated and to manage postpartum hemorrhage.[A229108,A229113] It is estimated that labor induction with oxytocin is used in almost 10% of deliveries globally.[A228593] \n\nIt should be noted that there are risks associated with oxytocin intervention during childbirth. Oxytocin should be used judiciously only when necessary and by experienced healthcare practitioners.[A229113]\n\nAlthough most commonly linked to labor and delivery, oxytocin actually has broad peripheral and central effects.[A229008] It plays an important role in pair bonding, social cognition and functioning, and even fear conditioning.[A229013] Oxytocin also serves a role in metabolic homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation.[A228593,A229098]",

Oxytocin may be used to reinforce labor in select cases of uterine inertia and as adjunctive therapy in the management of incomplete or inevitable abortion.

        "mechanism_of_action":"Integrins are transmembrane receptors and adhesion molecules that facilitate the chemotaxis of leukocytes to inflammation sites.[A261326] Made up of multiple subunits, α4 integrins form heterodimers with β-subunits to form functional molecules.[A261321] During inflammation, endothelial cells lining blood vessels are activated by cytokines. There is increased expression of cell adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), expressed on vascular endothelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. These cell adhesion molecules act as ligands or counter-receptors for α4 integrin receptors expressed primarily on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. The interaction between cell adhesion molecules and α4 integrin facilitates the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue, activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, and enhanced activity of local cytokines and chemokines. α4 integrin can also interact with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and osteopontin to further propagate inflammation.[A261321, L48031] Natalizumab binds to the α4 subunit of α4β1 and α4β7 integrin receptors to block the α4-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to their counter-receptors. In vitro, natalizumab also blocks α4-mediated cell binding to osteopontin and an alternatively spliced domain of fibronectin, connecting segment-1 (CS-1). In vivo, natalizumab may further inhibit the interaction of α4-expressing leukocytes with their ligand(s) in the extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells, thereby inhibiting further recruitment and inflammatory activity of activated immune cells.[L48031]\n\nThe specific mechanism(s) by which natalizumab exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease have not been fully defined. Lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves the interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells and their counter-receptors expressed on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Natalizumab blocks the molecular interaction of α4β1-integrin expressed by inflammatory cells with VCAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells and with CS-1 and\/or osteopontin expressed by parenchymal cells in the brain; thereby, natalizumab reduces leukocyte migration into brain parenchyma and reduces plaque formation associated with MS.[A261326, L48031]\n\nThe interaction of the α4β7 integrin with the endothelial receptor MAdCAM1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD). MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and is critical in homing T lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue found in Peyer’s patches. Increased MAdCAM-1 expression is often observed at active inflammation sites in patients with CD, suggesting that MAdCAM-1 may be involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa. The clinical effect of natalizumab in CD may, therefore, be secondary to the blockade of the molecular interaction of the α4ß7 integrin receptor with MAdCAM-1 expressed on the venular endothelium at inflammatory foci. VCAM-1 expression has been found to be upregulated on colonic endothelial cells in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease and appears to play a role in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation; however, the role of VCAM-1 in CD is unclear.[L48031]",
